## Code Formatting and Linting

### Prettier

I used Prettier for code formatting. It helps to format the code and making it consistent throughout the whole project.

### Eslint

For linting i used ESlint. It helped me catch errors in the code and uphold typescript standards. The Eslint file
follows common rules for this kind of project.
